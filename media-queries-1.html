<h1> Media Queries </h1>

<p> Media Queries have been around longer than responsive design. For example 
    there is a query for print which allows us to use different css when a 
    document is printed  </p>
    
<p> Since different screen sizes have apeared the query for screen size has 
    become very prevalent in design. </p>
